# LeadScoringCaseStudy
X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. 
X Education gets a lot of leads, but its lead conversion rate is very poor. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. 
In order to increase the lead conversion process more efficiently, the company wishes to identify the potential leads, who can be categorized as ‘Hot Leads’. 
Once ‘Hot Leads’ are acquired, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone. Business Goal: ● X Education needs help in selecting the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
